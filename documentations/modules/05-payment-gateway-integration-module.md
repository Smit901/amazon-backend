# Payment Gateway Integration Module

## Technical Tasks:

1. **Integrate Third-Party Payment Gateway:**
   - **Description:** Integrate a third-party payment gateway service such as PayPal or Stripe to facilitate secure online payments. This allows users to pay for their orders using various payment methods like credit cards, debit cards, and more.

2. **Implement Secure Payment Processing:**
   - **Description:** Implement secure payment processing to ensure that sensitive payment information (e.g., credit card details) is handled with the highest level of security. Use encryption and follow best practices for PCI DSS compliance.

3. **Handle Payment Confirmation and Order Fulfillment:**
   - **Description:** Implement the logic to handle payment confirmation from the payment gateway. Upon successful payment, update the order status to "Paid" and initiate the order fulfillment process.

## API Endpoints:

1. **Initiate Payment**
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/payment/initiate`
   - **Method:** POST

         "cvv": "123"
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Response:**
     - 200 OK - Payment initiated successfully. Returns payment confirmation details.
     - 400 Bad Request - Invalid input or payment processing error.

2. **Payment Confirmation Callback**
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/payment/callback`
   - **Method:** POST (Receives callback from the payment gateway)
   - **Request Body (Example):**
     ```json
     {
       "order_id": "order-12345",
       "status": "success",
       "transaction_id": "txn-98765",
       "payment_method": "credit_card"
     }
     ```
   - **Response:**
     - 200 OK - Payment confirmation received and processed.

## Additional Details:

- Ensure that payment processing complies with security standards such as PCI DSS to protect user payment information.
- Handle various payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and alternative payment options provided by the payment gateway.
- Implement error handling and logging for payment processing to troubleshoot issues.
- Keep track of payment statuses and transaction IDs associated with orders.
