# Admin Dashboard Module

## Technical Tasks:

1. **Create Admin Dashboard:**
   - **Description:** Develop an admin dashboard interface that provides administrative functionalities for managing products, orders, and user accounts. The dashboard should be user-friendly and efficient for administrators to perform their tasks.

2. **Implement Role-Based Access Control:**
   - **Description:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to distinguish between administrators and regular users. Admins should have access to the dashboard and administrative features, while regular users should not.

## API Endpoints:

1. **Product Management**
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/admin/products`
   - **Method:** GET
   - **Description:** Retrieve a list of products for management in the admin dashboard.
   - **Response:**
     - 200 OK - List of products retrieved successfully.
     - 401 Unauthorized - Access denied for non-admin users.

2. **Order Management**
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/admin/orders`
   - **Method:** GET
   - **Description:** Retrieve a list of orders for management in the admin dashboard.
   - **Response:**
     - 200 OK - List of orders retrieved successfully.
     - 401 Unauthorized - Access denied for non-admin users.

3. **User Management**
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/admin/users`
   - **Method:** GET
   - **Description:** Retrieve a list of user accounts for management in the admin dashboard.
   - **Response:**
     - 200 OK - List of users retrieved successfully.
     - 401 Unauthorized - Access denied for non-admin users.

## Additional Details:

- Admin dashboard functionalities should include features like adding/editing/removing products, managing orders (e.g., marking orders as shipped), and user account management.
- Implement user authentication and authorization middleware to enforce RBAC. Admins should have a special admin role assigned to their accounts.
- Ensure that sensitive admin operations, such as deleting products or managing user accounts, require admin-level privileges.
- Consider implementing audit logging to track admin actions for security and accountability.
- Make the admin dashboard responsive and user-friendly to enhance the admin experience.
