# Email Notifications Module

## Technical Tasks:

1. **Implement Email Notifications:**
   - **Description:** Implement automated email notifications for various events, including order confirmation, shipping updates, and password reset requests. These notifications will enhance user communication and keep them informed about their activities on the platform.

2. **Integrate Email Service Provider:**
   - **Description:** Integrate with an email service provider (nodemailer) to facilitate sending emails. This integration ensures reliable email delivery and provides features such as email templates and analytics.

## API Endpoints:

- This module primarily focuses on backend tasks related to sending email notifications and does not expose specific API endpoints. Email sending functionality can be triggered from other modules, such as the Order Management Module for order-related emails or the User Authentication Module for password reset emails.

## Additional Details:

- Implement email templates for order confirmation, shipping updates, and password reset emails. These templates should be customizable and include placeholders for dynamic content (e.g., order details, reset links).
- Utilize background processing or queuing mechanisms to send emails asynchronously, ensuring minimal impact on the application's response time.
- Implement error handling and logging to track email delivery status and troubleshoot any issues.
- Set up email tracking and analytics to monitor the performance of email notifications, such as open rates and click-through rates.
- Ensure compliance with email regulations and best practices, including providing users with the option to unsubscribe from non-essential emails.
