## Task Title: Affiliate Program Integration

### Technical Requirements

**Affiliate Dashboard:**

- Create an affiliate dashboard where affiliates can register, log in, and access their account information.
- Affiliates should be able to generate unique referral links for specific products or categories.

- Define a commission structure that outlines how much commission affiliates earn per sale or action (e.g., percentage of the sale amount).
- Allow flexibility to set different commission rates for different affiliates or products.

**Referral Tracking:**

- Implement a system to track referrals accurately. When a user clicks on an affiliate's referral link and makes a purchase, the affiliate should receive credit for the sale.
- Use cookies or other methods to ensure that even if the user doesn't make an immediate purchase but returns later, the affiliate still gets credit for the sale.

**Payout System:**

- Provide multiple payout options (e.g., bank transfer, PayPal) and set a minimum payout threshold.

**Reporting and Analytics:**

- Implement a notification system to inform affiliates of new sales generated through their referral links.

- Ensure affiliates accept these terms during registration.

**Integration with E-commerce Platform:**

- Integrate the affiliate system seamlessly with our existing e-commerce platform.

- Implement security measures to prevent fraudulent activities, such as click fraud or self-referrals.
